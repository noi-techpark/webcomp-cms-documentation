## Prerequisites

Adding Web Components to WIX is very straightforward. To follow this guide you will need a WIX account

## How to add web components

1. Login to your WIX account and create a new website. Alternatively you can use an existing one. In this guide we use a new one with an empty template.

2. Once the editor has loaded you can add a new component from the left side menu.

Alternatively you can also use a "Custom Element". However, this component is not included in the free plan.
